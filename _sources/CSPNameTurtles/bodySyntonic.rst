	single: Seymour Papert
	
One of the things that `Seymour Papert <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seymour_Papert>`_, the person who first used turtles in programming, most liked about the turtle is that students could test their programs using `body syntonic <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_graphics>`_ reasoning.  This means that a turtle moves in the way that a student moves.  Students can go forward and turn right.  A student can pretend to *be the turtle*, doing exactly what the program says.  In this video, our "turtle" person, Barbara Ericson, doesn't take 100 steps.  Instead, she goes forward 3 steps since her steps are so much larger than a turtle's.
