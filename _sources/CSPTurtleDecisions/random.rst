Using Random Numbers
======================

..	index::
    pair: random; randrange

We can generate random numbers in Python using the ``randrange`` function in the ``random`` library.  This function takes an optional starting value (inclusive) and the ending value for the range (exclusive).  We can use random numbers in games to add an element of chance.  We can also use random numbers to move the turtle to random positions as shown below.  We are using conditionals to alternate the drawing color each time the turtle moves.

    :tour_1: "Structural Tour"; 1-2: td3-line1-2; 3-5: td3-line3-5; 6-9: td3-line6-9; 10: td3-line10; 11: td3-line11; 12-13: td3-line12-13; 14-15: td3-line14-15; 16-18: td3-line16-18;

    from turtle import *      # use the turtle library
    import random 
    space = Screen()          # create a turtle screen (space)
    width = space.window_width()
    height = space.window_height()
    maxX = width / 2  # get the max x value
    minX = -1 * maxX
    maxY = height / 2 
    minY = -1 * maxY
    jaz = Turtle()            # create a turtle named jaz
    for num in range(10):
    	if num % 2 == 0:             # if even row
        	jaz.color('red')          # set the color to red
       	if num % 2 == 1:             # if odd row
        	jaz.color('black')       # set the color to black
       	randX = random.randrange(minX, maxX)
       	randY = random.randrange(minY, maxY)
       	jaz.goto(randX,randY)
       
.. mchoicemf:: 14_4_1_randrange1
   :answer_a: randX = random.randrange(minX, maxX)
   :answer_b: randX = random.randrange(0, maxX)
   :answer_c: randX = random.randrange(minX, 0)
   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: This will range from the minimum x value (inclusive) to the maximum x value (exclusive).  It will cover the whole width of the drawing area.
   :feedback_b: This will range from 0 to the maximum x value (exclusive).  It will cover the right half of the drawing area.
   :feedback_c: This will range from the minimum x value (inclusive) to 0.  It will cover the left half o the drawing area.

   What could you use to limit the x values to just the left half of the drawing space (screen)?
