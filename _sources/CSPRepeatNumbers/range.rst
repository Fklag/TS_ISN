The Range Function
====================

That long list of values in the variable ``numbers`` (``numbers = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]``), can also be generated by the ``range`` function.  The ``range`` function can take two ``input`` values.  The first one is the starting value, and the last one is the ending value **BUT**, the range doesn't include that value.  If only *one* value is given as input to ``range``, the list of numbers returned starts with zero.

.. activecode:: Numbers_Range
	
    print range(10)
    print range(1,10)
    print range(11)
    print range(1,11)

.. mchoicemf:: 7_4_1_Numbers_Range_Q1
   :answer_a: print range(10)
   :answer_b: print range(1,10)
   :answer_c: print range(11)
   :answer_d: print range(1,11)
   :correct: d
   :feedback_a: That includes zero and doesn't include 10: [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
   :feedback_b: That doesn't include 10: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
   :feedback_c: That includes zero: [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
   :feedback_d: That returns [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]

   Which of the following lines actually gives us the numbers we need to get the product of all numbers from 1 to 10?
   
Let's rewrite the program that calculates the product using the ``range`` function to generate the list of numbers as shown below.

.. activecode:: Numbers_Product2
    :tour_1: "Line by line tour"; 1: for2_line1; 2: for2_line2; 3: for2_line3; 4: for2_line4; 5: for2_line5;
	
    product = 1  # Start out with nothing
    numbers = range(1,11)
    for number in numbers:
    	product = product * number
    print(product)

.. mchoicemf:: 7_4_2_Numbers_Product_Q3
   :answer_a: 121645100408832000
   :answer_b: 3628800
   :answer_c: 362880
   :answer_d: 2432902008176640000
   :correct: d
   :feedback_a: That is the product of all numbers from 1 to 19 (e.g., you changed the 11 to 20)
   :feedback_b: That is the product of all numbers from 1 to 10 (e.g., no change at all)
   :feedback_c: That is the product of all numbers from 1 to 9 (e.g., you changed the 11 to 10)
   :feedback_d: That is the product of all numbers from 1 to 20 (e.g., you changed the 11 to 21)

   Change ONE number in the above program to tell us the product of all numbers from 1 to 20
