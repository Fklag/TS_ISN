Do bigger or richer states have more pollution?
================================================

What causes more pollution?
 
 - Maybe bigger states have more *stuff* and that leads to more pollution?
 - Maybe smaller states have more things crammed into a smaller place, and that leads to more pollution?
 - Maybe richer states have more industry, and that leads to more pollution?
 - Maybe more populous states have more people (so more cars and houses...) and that leads to more pollution?

Let's give you a way of asking these questions.  Let's write a program to get the average pollution **for a state**.
