State Data
======================================================

In this chapter, we're going to use another set of data (about the states) to give us insight into how we analyze the pollution data.

*Learning Objectives*:

This chapter of the book will address the following from the Computer Science Principles course:

 - *Big Idea 3: Data and Information*:
 - LO 3.1.1: ... Use computers to process information, find patterns, and test hypotheses about digitally processed information to gain insight and knowledge.
 - LO 3.2.1: ... Extract information from data to discover and explain connections, patterns, or trends. 
 - LO 3.2.2: ... Use large data sets to explore and discover information and knowledge.
